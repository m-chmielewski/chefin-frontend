AddRecipe:
 -If I am only tabbing without pressing enter or clicking anywhere lists dont disappear
 -useReducer
 -tags
 -Check if recipe name is already in use
 -create products that are not already in db
 - Scrolling to new row logic sloppy
 - dropdownsHandle logic sloppy
 - On submit scroll to top of the screen and focus on recipe name field
