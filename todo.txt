Button onHover works poorly on mobile

Scroll behavior on quanity fields is annoying

Error handling

validation onblur

Copy Settings from shoppin

useContext? - wouldnt it help with regular vision mode?

step up export game

Ideas:
 - Add products to shopping list 
 - Servings calculator
 - Schedule
 - For regular vision add side navigation

AddRecipe:
 - If I am only tabbing without pressing enter or clicking anywhere lists dont disappear
 - useReducer
 - tags
 - Check if recipe name is already in use
 - create products that are not already in db
 - Scrolling to new row logic sloppy
 - dropdownsHandle logic sloppy
 - On submit scroll to top of the screen and focus on recipe name field

Recipes:
 - Search

forRelease:
 - test on all screens
 - add recipes to prod db

SuggestiveInput:
 - scroll is ugly
 - List looks weird
