Button onHover works poorly on mobile

When added new row scroll appropriately and focus on input

Clear fields on submit

Scroll behavior on quanity fields is annoying

Error handling

validation onblur

Copy Settings from shoppin

useContext?

step up export game

AddRecipe:

 -useReducer
 -tags
 -Check if recipe name is already in use
 -create products that are not already in db
 - Improve suggestive field - not only starts with but also contains
